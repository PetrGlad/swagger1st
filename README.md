swagger1st is a Clojure [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) handler that parses, validates and routes requests
based on your [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)/OpenAPI definition. Instead of defining routes and validation rules in your code, you can use swagger1st along with [Swagger/OpenAPI's great tool set](http://editor.swagger.io/)to specify your API in the [Swagger 2.0 Specification format](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec). This enables you to specify your API in an API-First, technology-independent format. The resulting definition is the ultimate format for publishing, sharing and reviewing your API.

swagger1st will use it **[what, specifically?]** as a configuration file for processing incoming requestsâ€”ensuring that your implementation and specification always remain in sync. During runtime, you can inspect and easily test
your API with the built-in [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/). You can also extend the interpretation of
your definition according to your own needs.

Imagine a simple API definition like this:

```yaml
swagger: '2.0'

info:
  title: Example API
  version: '0.1'

paths:
  /helloworld:
    get:
      summary: Returns a greeting.
      operationId: example.api/generate-greeting
      parameters:
        - name: firstname
          in: query
          type: string
          pattern: "^[A-Z][a-z]+"
      responses:
          200:
              description: say hello
```

By default, this definition is connected to your business logic via the `operationId`, which might be defined like so:

```clojure
(ns example.api
  (:require [ring.util.response :as r]))

(defn generate-greeting [request]
  (let [firstname (-> request :parameters :query :name)]
    (-> (r/response (str "Hello " firstname "!"))
        (r/content-type "plain/text"))))
```

This is all you need to do to define and implement your API. Only fully validated requests get to your function,
so you can rely on swagger1st to properly check all input parameters according to your definition. The function itself
is a normal Clojure function without any dependencies to swagger1st - simple as that.

## Kickstart

### Leiningen Template

For the following steps, you need [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) installed.

#### Simple Setup

If you are bootstrapping a complete new project or just want to try out swagger1st, you can use the Leiningen template:

```
$ lein new swagger1st myproject
```

Go into the new project folder `myproject` and start a new webserver with `lein ring server-headless`. Go with your
browser to [http://localhost:3000/ui/](http://localhost:3000/ui/).

#### Complex Setup

You can also generate a project setup which includes Stuart Sierra's
[component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework in order to see how you can handle dependency injection
with swagger1st:

```
$ lein new swagger1st myproject +component
```

Go into the new project folder `myproject` and run its main function via `lein run -m myproject.core`. Go with your
browser to [http://localhost:3000/ui/](http://localhost:3000/ui/).

### Manual Setup

Use the following dependency in your [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) project:

    [org.zalando/swagger1st "<latest>"]

You find the latest version in [Maven central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/zalando/swagger1st/):

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.zalando/swagger1st.svg)

The following setup creates a ring compliant handler.

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.core :as s1st]
            [io.sarnowski.swagger1st.util.security :as s1stsec]))

(def app
  (-> (s1st/context :yaml-cp "my-swagger-api.yaml")
      (s1st/discoverer)
      (s1st/mapper)
      (s1st/parser)
      (s1st/protector {"oauth2" (s1stsec/allow-all)})
      (s1st/executor)))
```

## Complete Example Projects

Checkout the Leiningen templates as mentioned in the Kickstart section for working examples.

### Friboo

[Friboo](https://github.com/zalando-stups/friboo) is [Zalando](http://tech.zalando.com/)'s opinionated Clojure
microservice library which uses swagger1st at its base for RESTful HTTP endpoints and also integrates with the
[component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) framework. See the following projects who are real world
applications of Zalando's cloud infrastructure based on Friboo with swagger1st:

* [Kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio)
* [PierOne](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (a complete Docker registry based on S3)
* [essentials](https://github.com/zalando-stups/essentials)
* [TWINTIP](https://github.com/zalando-stups/twintip-storage)
* [mint](https://github.com/zalando-stups/mint-storage)

### swagger-mock

[swagger-mock](https://github.com/zalando/swagger-mock) is an example how to also use swagger1st. Since you have the
complete data of your Swagger definition at hand, you can modify it before processing and also use its definition
information during execution. This allows the swagger-mock to hook into your definition and parse the examples from it
in order to return them on each request.

## Compatibility Overview

swagger1st aims to implement all features of the Swagger 2.0 specification. Everything that you can define with Swagger
should be handled by swagger1st, so that you only have to write your business logic. Version 1.0 will implement all
elements (that makes sense to handle). Until then, the following document shows the current supported aspects of the
specification:

* [Swagger 2.0 Compatibility Document](comp-2.0.md)

## The Ring handler in detail

* `s1st/context` (required)
    * Creates a new context from a given definition. This context will be used by the next steps to prepare the
      execution of requests.
* `s1st/discoverer` (optional)
    * The discoverer enables certain HTTP endpoints, that makes it easy to work with your API. In particular, this
      enables the Swagger UI under the path `/ui/` and exposes the Swagger definition under `/swagger.json`.
* `s1st/mapper` (required)
    * The mapper denormalizes the given definition (e.g. resolves all `$ref`s) and figures out, which request definition
      maps to the actual incoming request. After this function, your `request` map contains the `:swagger` key, which
      contains a `:request` key containing the denormalized definition of the request and a `:key` key which can be used
      to uniquely identify a request.
* `s1st/parser` (required)
    * The parser parses the incoming request according to the definition and validates all inputs.
* `s1st/protector` (optional)
    * The protector can enforce all security definitions for you. As the security check implementations vary depending
      on your environment, this is only a framework to hook into the system and define callbacks for the actual checks.
* `s1st/executor` (required)
    * The executor executes your defined function in the end. At this point, the whole definition was validated and only
      valid requests make it up until here. You can also specify an own function resolver function in order to hook into
      your own framework.

## Development on swagger1st

Source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/zalando/swagger1st). Read
[this documentation](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) if you are just starting with GitHub. In addition,
you need [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) as the build tool, make sure it works first.

The following commands are a kickstarter for development:

```shell
# get the source
$ git clone https://github.com/zalando/swagger1st.git
$ cd swagger1st

# run the tests
$ lein test

# run all tests, including performance benchmarks
$ lein test :all

# build an own artifact for local development
$ lein install

# release a new version
$ lein release :minor
```

For interactive development, you can start a REPL by typing `lein repl`.
